# spotify-qt
This branch contains the current efforts to rewrite the main spotify-qt application in Rust, making it more modular in the process, hopefully making it possible to have alternative front-ends in the future, like GTK+3. This will likely be part of the v3.0 update.

## Why Rust?
Rust will make it easier to develop and maintain the application, as well as making it more reliable.
