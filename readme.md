# spotify-qt
A Spotify client using Qt as a simpler, lighter alternative to the official client. Inspired by [spotify-tui](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui).

Currently in beta. Most things should work, but don't be surprised when unexpected things happen.

## Known issues:
* Nothing is cached, so album art, playlists, etc. is fetched every time.
* Spotify API is pinged every second for updates.
* Probably very unstable.

## Not implemented yet:
* Library.
* Media controls (d-bus).
* Settings and log out.
